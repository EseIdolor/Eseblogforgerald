            The history of mathematics deals with the origin of discoveries in 
            mathematics and the mathematical methods and notation of the past. Before
             the modern age and the worldwide spread of knowledge, written examples of new
              mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales. From 3000
               BC the Mesopotamian states of Sumer, Akkad and Assyria, followed closely by 
               Ancient Egypt and the Levantine state of Ebla began using arithmetic, algebra and
                geometry for purposes of taxation, commerce, trade and also in the patterns in nature,
                 the field of astronomy and to record time and formulate calendars.
